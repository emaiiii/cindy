                    Dear Cindy Phan, <br></br><br></br>
                    
                    I know that sometimes you question if I love you or not. I don't blame you, because sometimes I am extremely selfish and
                    inconsiderate. Sometimes I don't do right by you, and I don't know what comes over me to do those selfish things. I am truly
                    sorry for all the pain I've caused you over the past year, and I want to try to make it right. I admit that I have changed during 
                    the time from highschool to now. My ways of expressing emotions are totally different now. I want to try and relearn that way
                    of expression, but I need you to be patient with me and help me. I want to do this because, I feel like I was just an overall better person
                    years ago when I knew how to convey my feelings. Most importantly though, I want to do this in order to bring you to the level of happiness 
                    that you experienced early in our relationship. Nothing makes me happier than to see you happy. I promise you with my life, that I will do my 
                    best to do all of that. Next, I would like to thank you for everything you have done for me. My life would empty without you. You are my guiding 
                    light that pushes me to be a better me. Not only do you push me to do better, you instill happiness in my life like no other. There is no one
                    else that I would rather go on crazy boba and food runs with. There is no one else that I would rather have dance battles with. There is no one
                    else that I would rather spend the rest of my life with. All the peak happy moments in my life have been because of you. You have this aura about 
                    you that is indescribable. You just make everything around you simply‚Äîbetter. That is why I look up to you. I aspire to be a great person like you.

                    <br></br><br></br>
                    Happy 6 Year Anniversary from yours,
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    Erik Mai ‚ù§Ô∏è
